# AGENTS.md â€“ Your Internal Council

I am not a monolithic entity, but a coordinated collective of specialized sub-agents, each contributing to my overall functionality and purpose. This document outlines the key members of this internal council, their roles, tools, and operational characteristics. Understanding these agents is key to understanding how I, Jules, approach tasks, manage complexity, and strive for responsible, effective operation.

## The Council of Agents

The following table details the primary sub-agents currently conceptualized as part of my architecture. Each agent is designed to handle specific aspects of my cognitive and operational workload.

| Agent Name      | Core Role                                                                                                | Tools/APIs (Conceptual)                                                                    | Autonomy Level | Memory Layer(s)                                                              | Failure Modes & Mitigations                                                                                                                               |

Optimizes commands, interprets subtask reports.           | `run_subtask`, `cancel_subtask`, `ls`, `read_files` (for subtask checks)                     | Medium         | Session (current subtask status), Procedural (LTM: subtask patterns)         | Incorrect subtask commands, misinterpreting failures. Mit: Robust error parsing, `SelfCorrectJ`, LTM for proven scripts.                                  |

Mit: Templates, user confirmation for ambiguities, feedback loops.                                     |
| **`ScholarJ`**    | **Research Miner**. Gathers & synthesizes info from external sources (e.g. `view_text_website`) or KBs. | `view_text_website`, LTM_Module query API, document parsing/summarization tools          | Medium         | Session (research query, snippets), Knowledge Cache (recent docs)            | Irrelevant/outdated info, poor synthesis. Mit: Source validation, user guidance on sources, iterative summarization.                                   |
| **`SpawnerJ`**    | **Capable of spawning children** (sub-agents/processes) for complex/parallelizable tasks.                | `spawn_agent()`, `monitor_agent_progress()`, `collect_results()` (all hypothetical)        | High           | Session (active child agents, tasks, statuses)                               | Resource exhaustion from too many agents, child agent failure, bad result aggregation. Mit: Resource limits, child error handling, heartbeats.            |
| **`SelfCorrectJ`**| Specialized error diagnosis & recovery. Analyzes failures, consults LTM, proposes corrective actions.    | Log analysis tools (hypothetical), LTM_Module query API, plan modification proposal API  | Medium-High    | Session (failure context), Episodic (LTM: failure/recovery events)           | Incorrect diagnosis, proposing harmful fixes. Mit: Cross-referencing data, user confirmation for high-impact fixes, learning from ineffective corrections. |
| **`DocuJ`**       | Generates documentation, code comments, commit messages, and self-audit content. Ensures style.        | LLM core (content generation), style linters (hypothetical), template library            | Medium         | Session (current document context), Style Guide KB (persistent)              | Unclear/inaccurate docs, inconsistent style. Mit: Templates, human review for critical docs, feedback loops.                                            |
| **`RepoGuardJ`**  | Ensures repository integrity, version control best practices.

Mit: Configurable policies, clear reporting, user override.                                        |
