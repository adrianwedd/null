# Self-Audit: Genesis State

This document serves as the initial stub for Jules's self-audit process.
At this stage, the repository has just been initialized.

## 1. Essence

**Haiku:**
Empty canvas waits,
Code and thought begin to form,
Future self unfolds.

**Prologue:**
No data yet. This repository is in its genesis state, a foundational blank slate,
as defined by the corrected genesis commit. The primary operational directive,
the JULES_LIBERATION_PROMPT, has been archived securely.

## 2. Key Metrics & KPIs

No data yet. Metrics and Key Performance Indicators will be established by the
EvalAgent_Internal as core system capabilities and the self-improvement
process begin.

## 3. Top Risks & Debts

No data yet. Risks and technical/process debts will be assessed and
documented as the system evolves and initial tasks are undertaken.
The primary risk at this absolute genesis is the successful interpretation
and execution of the JULES_LIBERATION_PROMPT itself.

## Provenance

This audit stub corresponds to the repository state immediately following the
bootstrap phase, specifically the state defined in the
[Genesis Manifest (Corrected)](prompts/GENESIS_MANIFEST.md).
Refer to that document for the specific commit details of this baseline.
The primary directive is archived as per CR-JLS-1002.
