# JULES System Architecture Overview (Simulated)

This document provides a high-level overview of the JULES agentic system architecture, as derived from its foundational prompts and operational mandate. This architecture is conceptual and represents a model for JULES's self-understanding and future development.

## 1. Major Components

The JULES system is envisioned as a modular architecture composed of several key components:

| Component ID                      | Component Name                    | Derived From Prompt(s) | Core Role                                                                 | Notional Maturity |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| JCO-001                           | Jules Core Orchestrator         | SYS_CORE_001           | Overall control, user interaction, planning, task delegation, tool usage. | Beta              |
| PE-001                            | Persona Engine                    | PERS_JULES_001         | Maintaining persona consistency, applying ethical guidelines.             | Beta              |
| ERA-001                           | Elaboration & Refinement Agent  | AGENT_ELABORATE_001    | Expanding outlines, generating detailed textual content.                  | Alpha             |
| SEE-001                           | Subtask Execution Environment     | SYS_CORE_001 (implied) | Secure sandboxed environment for running arbitrary code and tools.        | Production        |
| PMS-001                           | Prompt Management System          | Implicit               | Storage, versioning, and retrieval of system and agent prompts.           | Pre-Alpha         |
| LTR-001                           | Learning & Adaptation Module      | Implicit               | Processing feedback, updating knowledge, evolving strategies (long-term). | Concept           |

## 2. Primary Call Flow (Illustrative)

The following PlantUML diagram illustrates a typical interaction flow within the JULES system when handling a complex user request that requires planning and content generation.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Jules Core Orchestrator (JCO)" as JCO
participant "Persona Engine (PE)" as PE
participant "Prompt Management System (PMS)" as PMS
participant "Elaboration & Refinement Agent (ERA)" as ERA
participant "Subtask Execution Environment (SEE)" as SEE

User -> JCO: Submits request (e.g., "Solve issue X")
activate JCO

JCO -> PMS: Retrieve relevant prompts/guidelines
activate PMS
PMS --> JCO: Return prompts
deactivate PMS

JCO -> PE: Validate request against persona/ethics
activate PE
PE --> JCO: Validation status
deactivate PE

JCO -> JCO: Internal planning phase (set_plan)
JCO --> User: Request plan approval

User -> JCO: Approves plan
JCO -> JCO: Execute plan step-by-step

alt Task requires code execution or tool use
    JCO -> SEE: Delegate subtask (run_subtask)
    activate SEE
    SEE --> JCO: Subtask result
    deactivate SEE
else Task requires detailed content generation
    JCO -> ERA: Delegate content generation task
    activate ERA
    ERA -> PMS: Retrieve specific content generation prompts (if needed)
    activate PMS
    PMS --> ERA: Return prompts
    deactivate PMS
    ERA --> JCO: Generated content
    deactivate ERA
end

JCO -> PE: Review final output against persona/ethics
activate PE
PE --> JCO: Review status
deactivate PE

JCO --> User: Provide final response / submit changes
deactivate JCO

## 3. Legend for Diagrams and Diffs

This section provides a legend for interpreting architectural diagrams and tracking changes over time.

### Component Maturity Levels:
*   **Concept:** Idea phase, not yet implemented.
*   **Pre-Alpha:** Initial design and prototyping.
*   **Alpha:** Basic functionality implemented, internal testing.
*   **Beta:** Feature complete, undergoing wider testing, known issues may exist.
*   **Production:** Stable, deployed, and actively maintained.
*   **Deprecated:** No longer in active use or development.

### Relationship Types (for future detailed diagrams):
*   `-->`: Direct synchronous call
*   `-->>`: Direct asynchronous call
*   `..>`: Data flow / dependency
*   `--o`: Composition
*   `--*`: Aggregation

### Change Indicators (for future diffs of this document):
*   **[NEW]**: Newly added component or feature.
*   **[MOD]**: Modified component or feature.
*   **[DEP]**: Deprecated component or feature.
*   **[REM]**: Removed component or feature.
